# **LinkedGym**

![Mock up](wireframes/mock-up.png)

## **Goal for this project**
Have you ever gone to the gym and not planned a workout? You waste so much time looking around seeing
what equipment is free aimlessly doing random exercises with no planning and leaving feeling you have to do nothing!

LinkedGym is for you. Instead of spending hours looking and planning a workout, you can log on to LinkedGym and find
one posted by a user that you would like to do. And if you have a good gym session, you can post the workout plan and share it with 
the other site members.

LinkedGym allows users to share their workout and view other users workouts, ranging from muscle groups specific to 
a full-body workout.

### **Structure**
In order to create an overall structure for my website, I have chosen to use Materialize. The CSS and Javascript elements offered by Materialize make it easy to keep a good structure for my page. I chose Materialize mainly because of the variety of features they offer such as a date picker, collapsable menus and responsive buttons.
